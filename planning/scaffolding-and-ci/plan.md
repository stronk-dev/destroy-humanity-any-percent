# CI Baseline — Implementation Plan

- **RFC:** `rfc/scaffolding-and-ci.md`
- **Assignee:** Codex
- **Started:** 2026-07-28
- **Status:** fast/maintenance split implemented locally; hosted acceptance pending

## Work

1. [x] Split the Makefile into server, client, browser, schema, and aggregate verification targets.
2. [x] Add a pinned Ajv 2020-12 schema verifier plus positive and negative catalog fixtures.
3. [x] Add the least-privilege hosted workflow with frozen installs, dependency caches, pinned
   browser installs, and superseded-run cancellation.
4. [x] Exercise every narrow Make target and the aggregate local gate.
5. [x] Update README and canonical CI documentation.
6. [ ] Observe the first hosted workflow under five minutes, then archive the completed RFC and
   planning record.
7. [x] Under D-014, split push/PR harness smoke from scheduled/manual exhaustive harness and
   numeric evidence; enforce the topology with seeded failures.
8. [ ] Observe a green current-head push/PR workflow and one complete scheduled/manual harness
   observation before claiming hosted closeout.

## Acceptance gates

- Clean, frozen dependency installation succeeds.
- Server, client, browser, and schema targets pass independently.
- A negative schema fixture is rejected while the schema command succeeds by observing that
  expected rejection.
- `make verify` passes, including all three browser engines.
- Workflow structure has read-only permissions, push/PR triggers, branch-scoped cancellation,
  supported action majors, browser/package version parity, and no browser-binary cache.
- Blocking elapsed time is measured on GitHub after the amended workflow is pushed; the RFC cannot
  claim the hosted-runner five-minute gate from a local machine.
- Scheduled/manual exhaustive execution must upload a complete validated observation, or an
  explicit incomplete artifact when the 50-minute command ceiling fires.
