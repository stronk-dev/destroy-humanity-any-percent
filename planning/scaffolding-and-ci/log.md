# CI Baseline — Running Log

## 2026-07-28 — Start

- Owner selected a public repository, resolving the draft's only blocking owner decision.
- Narrowed the inherited draft to executable CI behavior; deployment, reconnect, assets, copy,
  and formula policy gates have named future owners.
- Verified current primary documentation before acceptance: checkout/setup-go/setup-node and
  pnpm setup use supported v6 majors; Playwright requires its Docker image version to match the
  installed package, which is 1.62.0 here.
- Selected Node 24 and the Noble Playwright 1.62.0 image. Browser binaries come from the image and
  are deliberately not cached.
- Selected pinned Ajv 8.20.0 for Draft 2020-12 schema and fixture validation so local and CI use
  one repository-owned command rather than a globally installed utility.
