# Minigame Platform Foundation implementation log

## 2026-08-04 — acceptance reconciliation and start

- Owner rulings C1–C18 were reconciled into MP1, MP4, MP5, and the acceptance criteria before
  implementation. One stale AC4 phrase found during the implementation read was corrected from
  client-intent language to the ruled server-authored `resolve_minigame_session` transition.
- Implementation starts at the dependency floor: the Postgres session/claim boundary, followed by
  the tenant registry. No production payout, fallback, or offline-quality number will be invented.
