# WebSocket Transport & Fan-out — append-only log

## 2026-07-29 — start

- Accepted through `planning/codex-batch-2026-07-29.md` after T1–T6 closed identity, inbound intent,
  wire, recovery, literal-limit, and runnable-lifecycle gaps.
- Verified the current official Go module releases before pinning: embedded Centrifuge v0.38.0 and
  coder/websocket v1.8.15. Centrifuge remains pre-v1, so its minor version is treated as an API
  boundary and pinned exactly.
- Implementation begins with strict data/config and recovery behavior before the HTTP/WebSocket
  composition, keeping protocol semantics testable without sockets.
