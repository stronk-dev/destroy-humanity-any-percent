# Pet Adoption v1 — implementation log

## 2026-09-25 — Predeclaration (Claude)

**Implemented by:** Claude. **Review:** awaiting Codex designated cross-party review.

Scope is `plan.md` P1–P7, fixture-first, with no production epoch mint.

- **Numbering:** Founder v23, the next free version, since Reputation took v22. Migrations start at
  00079. The replay-inputs version is the next free one.
- **Kernel protocol:** every commit that touches a guarded path bumps `kernel/VERSION` in the same
  commit.

**Recorded reading (scalar Founder chain, C17):** Founder v23 = v22 + `pet_identities`, so a
bundle that pins `pet_species` must also pin `reputation_tree`, which transitively pins
`minigame_api` → … → `pets`. The RFC names only `pets` as a prerequisite. The stronger chain is
forced by the existing scalar version design, not chosen here. PA2's "pet_species requires pets"
stays true.
