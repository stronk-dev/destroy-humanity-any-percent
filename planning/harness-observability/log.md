# Harness Observability implementation log

Append-only session record. A fresh agent should be able to resume from this file plus the RFC.

## 2026-08-21 — implementation start

- Owner authority and the accepted RFC landed at `9c71562`; the implementation range begins after
  that commit.
- Read RFC-0000, the vision/tech/content versioning constraints, CI Baseline, the archived Balance
  Harness Foundation, current balance-harness docs, R-001 diagnosis, the CLI check path, relevance
  registry loader, and relevance report work-accounting seams.
- The implementation firewall is measurement-only. No population, governed bytes, budgets,
  timeout, dispatch, topology, balance, gameplay or release claim may move in this range.
- Planned the recorder at the CLI orchestration boundary and the selector through the registered
  loader. Claude is intentionally absent until the mandatory final exact-range review.
