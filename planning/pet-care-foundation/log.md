# Pet Care Foundation implementation log

## 2026-08-05 — owner rulings and implementation start

- Owner accepted C1-C8. The central deliverable is the reusable Founder-only transition and replay
  boundary; care must never mutate through Company `ApplyLogged` or spend Company state.
- Reconciled the normative body at the decision sites: fixed mechanical stat IDs, care through
  `ApplyFounderLogged`, and no Company resource/time/token cost.
- Implementation starts with persistence and replay plumbing. Production pet content and numeric
  policy rows remain owner/harness data and will not be invented.
