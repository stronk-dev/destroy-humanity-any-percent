# Terminal Typer log

## 2026-09-25 — Predeclaration (Claude)

**Implemented by:** Claude, per the owner's 2026-09-25 acceptance and implement direction.
**Review:** Codex designated cross-party review required before any archival. Nothing here is
self-approved.

Batches B1–B7 as in `plan.md`. Each batch lands with failing-first tests, a severing probe per
gate, and cold `-count=1` runs. Copy: mechanical keys ship with implementer-drafted candidate text
in `copy/catalog/typer-candidate.json`. That text is owner-adoption material, not ruled copy.
Prompt `text` rows in the fixture are PROVISIONAL placeholders (OD-9), not for production mint.

## 2026-09-25 — B1: content + pure engine (Claude)

**Implemented by:** Claude. **Review:** awaiting Codex designated review.

Landed:
- `server/typer` and `client/src/typer`, registered in `kernel/affecting-paths.json`; kernel bumped
  0.3.102 → 0.3.103 in this commit.
- `ApplyInput.ServerTimeMs` (TT-PA1 item 2), which Pitch ignores.
- Fixture `balance/testdata/typer-v1.json` with 15 placeholder prompts.
- Candidate copy `copy/catalog/typer-candidate.json`, which is owner-adoption material.
- The shared corpus, `make typer-corpus`/`typer-corpus-check`, and `docs/minigame-terminal-typer.md`.

Evidence (cold, `-count=1`):
- `./typer ./minigame` pass. `client/test/typer-content-gate.test.ts` passes 6/6.
- Severing probes, each turned red (Go/TS):
  - no `max` on the clock (TestTyperClockNeverRewinds);
  - deadline `>=` (content gate);
  - the run substream used directly, as a compiling mutant; a first, non-compiling attempt is
    discarded (Go content gate; TS 2 failed);
  - clears counted as clean (TestTyperCleanLineAccounting and the gate);
  - unsorted nested `last_submission` fields (TestTyperSnapshotsAreRegistryCanonical);
  - TS case folding;
  - TS truncation instead of `line_too_long`;
  - **TS NFKC.** It first SURVIVED, because no vector used a character that NFKC folds and OD-7
    does not map. A fullwidth look-alike vector was added to Go, TS and the corpus. Rerun: TS
    2 failed.

Implementation decisions, all within ruled text:
- **Validation order.** `invalid_text` is validated at command decode, which is phase-independent
  like Pitch's `hand_too_large`. `illegal_phase` precedes `line_too_long`, because the length
  bound needs the content.
- **Terminal handling.** `end_run` and `timed_out` retain `last_submission`.
- **`ValidateResult`** is content-free and checks structural bounds: facts ≥ 0,
  `clean ≤ cleared`, `assisted ∈ {0,1}`. The engine enforces `run_length` and the hardcaps.

**DESIGN-GAP (minor, recorded):** the RFC does not say whether U+FFFD submitted legitimately is a
miss or `invalid_text`. Both runtimes treat it as `invalid_text`, because Go's decoder cannot tell
it apart from invalid UTF-8.

## 2026-09-25 — B2: TT-PA1 server-sampled command time (Claude)

**Implemented by:** Claude. **Review:** awaiting Codex designated review.

- **What changed.** `Repository.claim` samples the DB clock in the claim transaction and carries it
  on the claimed session. `play` hands it to the tenant (`ServerTimeMs`). `completePlay` and
  `CompletePlayWithReceipt` insert it (both have a new `serverMS` parameter). The terminal
  resolution carries it in `resolutionIdentity.serverMS`, and `resolveTx` inserts it.
  `validateReplayTx` replays with each row's persisted `server_ts_ms` and with the resolution's
  sample for the terminal command. Kernel 0.3.103 → 0.3.104 (`server/minigame` is guarded).
- **AC3 witness.** `TestServerTimeSampleReachesTenantAndLogIntegration` (real Postgres) uses a
  tenant that records `ServerTimeMs` and stalls 25 ms inside `Apply`. The persisted stamp must
  equal the tenant's stamp for all 3 commands, terminal included, and certified replay must pass.
- **Severing, each turned red:**
  - reinstating the insert-time `clock_timestamp()` read (anchor match confirmed): replay
    diverges;
  - replay that omits the persisted stamps: diverges.
- **Evidence (cold):**
  - `./minigame ./production ./typer ./pitch` unit tests pass.
  - Postgres integration for `./minigame`, `./production ./save` and `./gameserver ./account`
    passes on separate runs.
  - One earlier combined run failed across packages because another agent's concurrent
    `compose.save-test.yml` run restarted and truncated the shared Postgres service. Each package
    passed when re-run alone. This is noted as environment interference, not treated as a pass
    of the combined run.

## 2026-09-25 — B3: TT-PA2 `tier_at_least` unlock arm (Claude)

**Implemented by:** Claude. **Review:** awaiting Codex designated review.

- **What changed.** The Go loader (`loadUnlockCondition`) and TS loader (`parseUnlock`) accept the
  exact arm with an optional `exit_history_at_least`. `UnlockCondition.TierUnlockFailure` is the
  single predicate. The start coordinator (`StartMinigameAPISession`) rejects with the new
  sentinel errors before Founder transition and tenant creation. Kernel 0.3.104 → 0.3.105.
- **Evidence (cold):**
  - `./minigame ./production` pass. `TestTierAtLeastUnlockArm` covers 4 accepted rows, 7 rejected
    rows and the predicate truth table. The TS `minigame-catalog.test.ts` passes 4/4.
  - Severing, each turned red:
    - Go without the tier bound;
    - Go without the exit clause;
    - TS without the tier integer check (1 failed).
- **Deferred, stated:**
  - The HTTP mapping of the two details and the schema detail enum move to B5 (TT-PA4). The
    concurrent Garage-surfaces agent holds uncommitted edits in `server/account/*_schema.go` and
    the generated API artifacts, and regenerating now would sweep them into this commit. Until
    then a gated start surfaces as an unmapped error; no production bundle pins a tier-gated row
    yet.
  - The composed AC9 start witness (Tier 0 rejects, Tier 1 with an exit starts) lands with B4,
    which makes a Typer row pinnable.
- **Note for other owners:** `server/gameui/features.go`, uncommitted and owned by the Garage agent,
  computes minigame availability with only the `fiscal_unlock` arm. It must call
  `TierUnlockFailure` for Typer's row, or the availability preview will disagree with the server.

## 2026-09-25 — B4: TT-PA3 content resolver, loader chain, composition (Claude)

**Implemented by:** Claude. **Review:** awaiting Codex designated review.

- **What changed.**
  - `CatalogBundle.Typer` and `CatalogBundle.TenantContent`; `ResolveTenantContent` now delegates
    to it.
  - Bundle validation counts `typer` and requires `minigame_api`.
  - `replaycatalog.Load` loads `typer` and enforces the definition ⟺ artifact ⟺ API-tenant chain,
    including a definition row with no API.
  - The start coordinator checks the requested tenant's own content instead of
    `bundle.Pitch != nil`.
  - `gameserver.Compose` registers the Typer tenant.
  - TS `loadReplayCatalogBundle` mirrors all of it.
  - Fixtures: the TT1 row (`testdata/minigame/pitch-typer-v3.json`) and the two-tenant API
    fixture.
  - Kernel 0.3.105 → 0.3.106.
- **Evidence (cold):**
  - Go `./production ./replaycatalog ./gameserver ./minigame ./typer ./harness` pass.
    `TestLoadTyperChainIsAllOrNothing` covers the complete chain, 6 broken chains and the
    Pitch-only resolution. `TestTyperTenantRowLoads` passes.
  - TS: `replay.test.ts` passes 86/86 (the new chain test has 5 broken-chain cases).
    `test-client` passes 6691. Typecheck is clean.
- **Severing:**
  - Go chain checks disabled: red on "definition without api or artifact". The first attempt
    didn't compile (unused variables) and is not counted; it was redone as a compiling mutant.
  - TS chain check disabled: red.
